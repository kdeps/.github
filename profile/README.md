Kdeps reduces the complexity of building self-hosted APIs powered by open-source LLMs.

It packs everything an RAG AI Agent needs in a Dockerized image, that can be deployed on/off cloud anytime, anywhere.

It uses open-source LLMs, so there's no need to buy any AI services and subscriptions for your AI-powered APIs.

Take a look at our quickstart guide [here](https://kdeps.github.io/kdeps/getting-started/introduction/quickstart.html), and several [example projects](https://github.com/kdeps/examples).
